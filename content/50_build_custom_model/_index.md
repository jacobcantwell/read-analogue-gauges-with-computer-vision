## Build a Custom Model with Amazon SageMaker

Let's get started on our first experiment!

{{% notice info %}}
For this and all other labs, ensure you are in the **US-EAST-1** region.
{{% /notice %}}

In this lab, you'll learn how to build a custom deep learning image classification model with Amazon SageMaker and then deploy it to a public inference endpoint for testing with a pre-built client application.

The Amazon SageMaker object-detection model you will build is based on the same dataset that was used in the previous Ground Truth labelling lab except all of the labelling has been completed already. The dataset includes a large number of images of analogue gauges.
