# 2.2 Baseline Metrics

As we go through this workshop you want to always compare your experiment results to the steady state of your application. 

Let's navigate to [Container Insights](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#container-insights:performance) browser tab to view the metrics we've generated.

From here you can choose a number of different views. Weâ€™re going to narrow down our timelines to a custom time range of just 30 minute so we can zoom into our recently collected insights.

To do so go to the Time Range option at the top right of The CloudWatch Container Insights windows and selecting 30 minutes.
