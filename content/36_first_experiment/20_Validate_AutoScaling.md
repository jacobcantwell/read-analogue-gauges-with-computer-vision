# 2.3 Validate Auto-Scaling
## Plan Experiment 
This first scenario that we‚Äôll run is to verify and help tune autoscaling. Autoscaling in AWS is easy to accomplish, but hard to master due to it being a means to scale infrastructure relative to traffic demands.

We talked about following the scientific method when doing chaos engineering experiment, the experiment card below helps you build the experiments.

You want to write down your **Hypothesis** and **Abort Conditions** before moving to the next step. Your **hypothesis** should be based on what you expect to happen to your system as you unleash the chaos, and the **abort conditions** will cover the conditions that would cause you to halt the experiment. 

Here is an example of my experiment card:

## Unleash Experiment
We will start off by going back to [Gremlin](https://app.gremlin.com) to configure a CPU attack on all of our hosts.

Click on **"Attacks"** which can be found on the left navigation bar followed by **"New Attack".**

Under **"What do you want to attack?"**,  you want to select **Hosts**, followed by your three hosts.

Under **‚ÄúChoose a Gremlin‚Äù**, select **"Resource"** followed by **"CPU"** to consume the CPU on your targets. For the configuration, change **Length** to 360 seconds, change **CPU Capacity** to **`80`** and select **"All Cores"** from the dropdown.

Then click **"Unleash Gremlin"**

üéâ Congrats, you've unleashed your first attack! In the next page, we will talk about observing the chaos engineering experiment we just unleashed.
