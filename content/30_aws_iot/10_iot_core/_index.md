### Endpoint

Open AWS IoT. In the left menu bar, select **Settings**.

The custom endpoint allows you to connect IoT devices to AWS IoT. This is also an important property to insert when using an MQTT client or the AWS IoT Device SDK.

The endpoint has the suffix *.iot.us-east-1.amazonaws.com*

Copy the Endpoint value to your local computer.
