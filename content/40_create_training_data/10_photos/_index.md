## Existing photos

You can download a collection of photos of the real and virtual gauges.

[Pressure guage photo collection](10_photos/images/images-pressure-gauge.zip)

## New photos

Use your camera phone to take at least a dozen photos of your gauges.

Use AWS IoT to change the value of the gauge, and take photos at different pressures.

The photos should have the whole face of the gauge visible. Try different angles and lighting conditions. The more variety the better the training model will be.
