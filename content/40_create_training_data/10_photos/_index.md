## New photos

Use your camera phone to take at least a dozen photos of your virtual gauges.

Use AWS IoT to change the value of the gauge, and take photos at different pressures.

The photos should have the whole face of the gauge visible. Try different angles and lighting conditions. The more variety the better the training model will be.

Save your photos in a local folder in your computer.
