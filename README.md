# Read Analogue Gauges With Machine Learning on AWS

Analogue pointer-type dials are widely applied in many industries such as Oil & Gas. Visual inspection to remote oil well sites is necessary to obtain readings from analog gauges. This means a human operator must travel to the gaugeâ€™s location, read its current value, and log that value to enable the data to be used elsewhere. This is a time consuming and expensive process and it is prone to human errors. An alternative to the manual readings is to record a video of the gauge and analyze the pressure variations using computer vision techniques. This project shows how to use AWS IoT services to read analogue gauges remotely.
